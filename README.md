# Raspberry Pi Home Management
Home automation/monitoring software that does more than just toggle appliances.

The software will consist of a Java program that runs on a Raspberry Pi, acting as the server, along with Web and Mobile apps.

The web app will be hosted by the Pi, and users on the same network can connect to it through a web browser.

Accompanying iOS and Android apps will be written using <a href="https://github.com/multi-os-engine/multi-os-engine">Multi-OS Engine</a>.
